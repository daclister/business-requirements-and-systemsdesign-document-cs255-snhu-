(1)Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client, DrivePass, aspired to establish an educational online training system aimed at assisting students in obtaining their driving licenses through the utilization of practice examinations and on-road training. The envisioned system's core objective was to proficiently prepare students for their driving tests conducted at the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). The proprietor, Liam, sought a comprehensive solution capable of seamlessly managing all facets of the business operations. These encompassed functionalities such as reservations, payment processing, scheduling, tracking, managerial oversight, and timely updates. It was a fundamental requirement that the system facilitate universal data accessibility across various devices, while concurrently ensuring the circumvention of data redundancy. The proposed system necessitated the implementation of user-specific privileges and roles, thus granting distinct users with varying levels of access. Furthermore, the system intended to offer customers a range of three distinct packages to choose from, tailored to their individual preferences and requirements.
